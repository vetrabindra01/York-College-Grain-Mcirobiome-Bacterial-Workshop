# York College Sourdough Microbiome Workshop

# Introduction
‘Sourdough’ breads, made using flours milled from grains including wheat and rye, are leavened with a natural starter. The starter microbiome originates from microorganisms found in grain and flour. Its composition changes markedly on incubation with regular feedings. Leavening results from yeast fermentation of the low concentration of simple sugars found in flour, and souring is due to acidifying bacteria such as lactobacilli. 
	To initiate a long-term project, we analyzed rye and wheat berry microbiomes by amplification and sequencing of colonies obtained from plate cultures. Genera were identified using a 16S rRNA primer pair for bacteria and an Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) pair for fungi. Remarkably, dominant fungal and  bacterial genera characteristic of a mature starter were not observed among genera identified in the grains.
